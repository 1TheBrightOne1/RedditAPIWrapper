I'm wondering how long the weed bubble will last. Sure long term growth is huge in the cannabis sector but the short term gains we're seeing are very unsustainable. I hopped in real quick and hopped right back out. Got me a taste of the good life before tempering my expectations.
Ngl, they had us in the beginning. Nice try Melvin shill. /s
People been investing in apha since before the gme hype. It's how it has always been in this sub. Hype dies and people move on to the next play.
Doesn’t shock me... the newbies on here think everything is about shorts and squeezes but they’ll learn when they never go to the moon. God help them lmao
I am not doubting you here but I am curious why SNDL is part of this rally when they are a Canadian based company.
If anything WSB did do, it was give it more attention. The buzz seems to have been going on for some time now, just that people were too focused on GME and AMC. I was skeptical at first, but searching around, it has been discussed for some time now. Like anything else, the minute that the gains come in, everyone will hop on it. There's no telling where this will go, but just don't get greedy.
$SNDL to expensive now? $TGIFF still in sub $1 just a thought from some tard on the net
Sure, but the insane level of attention it is receiving on the sub along with the thousands of comments such as "I missed the boat with GME but I won't miss this one!" And "Just sold all my GME to by SNDL!" is a blatant attempt to move focus away from GME when most REAL wallstreetbets followers are still very much focused on and interested in GME. Especially me who just bought more today! We will not be fooled so easily!!!
